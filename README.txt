# Cellular Automata Simulator

A Python program for simulating Cellular Automata with built-in functionalities for various rulesets and animations.

## Features

- **Multiple Rulesets**: Supports a variety of predefined rulesets for simulating different types of cellular automata.
- **Customizable Grid**: Allows users to define the size and initial state of the grid.
- **Animations**: Visualizes the evolution of the automaton over time with smooth animations.
- **Entropy**: Calculate the Shannon entropy for each instance of the automata

## Installation
